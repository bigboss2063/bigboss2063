## Hi there 👋

### About me

My name is Bruce Chen, you can call me bigboss or bb. The reason I am called "bigboss" is that I am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid games.

I am a backend development engineer. ~~I am very interested in system programming and database kernel, and I hope to work in this field in the future.~~ (I failed. 😥)

Besides coding, my favorite thing in life is listening to music, especially r&b. Khalil Fong and Dean Ting are my favorite singers.
