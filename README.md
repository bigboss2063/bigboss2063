## Hi there 👋

### About me

My name is Bruce Chen, you can call me bigboss or bb.The reason I am called “bigboss” is that I am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid games.

I am a second-year graduate student majoring in computer science. I am very interested in system programming and database kernel, and I hope to work in this field in the future.

Besides coding, my favorite thing in life is listening to music, especially r&b. David Tao and Dean Ting are my favorite singers.

### Projects

I'm currently working on [nutsdb](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb) as a maintainer. In the future, I will optimize nutsdb one step further, and add some paper practice to nutsdb.

Now I'm really interested in Rust, wanting to participate in some database projects written in Rust.

Otherwise, I think I will participate more in some distributed or time series database projects, instead of limiting myself to only storage engines.
