## Hi there 👋

### About me

My name is Bruce Chen, you can call me bigboss or bb.The reason I am called “bigboss” is that I am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid games.

I am a second-year graduate student majoring in computer science. I am very interested in system programming and database kernel, and I hope to work in this field in the future.

Besides coding, my favorite thing in life is listening to music, especially r&b. David Tao and Dean Ting are my favorite singers.

### Projects

I’m currently working on [CouloyDB](https://github.com/Kirov7/CouloyDB) as a maintainer and I want to make this a production level project 🤨.

I'm also working on [nutsdb](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb) as a member, and I hope one day I can be a maintainer of nutsdb 😄.
