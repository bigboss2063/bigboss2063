## Hi there 👋

### About me

My name is Bruce Chen, you can call me bigboss or bb.The reason I am called “bigboss” is that I am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid games.

I am a second-year graduate student majoring in computer science. I am very interested in system programming and database kernel, and I hope to work in this field in the future.

### Projects

I’m currently working on [CouloyDB](https://github.com/Kirov7/CouloyDB) as a maintainer and I want to make this a production level project.

I'm getting ready to participate in [nutsdb](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb).
