## Hi there 👋

### About me

My name is Bruce Chen, you can call me bigboss or bb. The reason I am called "bigboss" is that I am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid games.

I am a backend development engineer. ~~I am very interested in system programming and database kernel, and I hope to work in this field in the future.~~ (I failed. 😥)

Besides coding, my favorite thing in life is listening to music, especially r&b. Khalil Fong and Dean Ting are my favorite singers.

### Projects

I'm currently working on [nutsdb](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb) as a maintainer. In the future, I will optimize nutsdb one step further, and add some paper practice to nutsdb.

I am currently passionate about developing AI Agent systems. Perhaps this is a direction for the future.
